# TODO

Marco & Davide - Calculate ICC. Write it to the Results.

Marco & Davide - Interpret ICC. Write it to the Results.

Marco & Davide - Explain how the data fits the assumptions for the analysis.

Fabio & Carlo - Be confident to explain each term in the statistical model. Write it to the Methodology.

Carlo - Analyse how the age binning is being done: what ages are grouped in each bucket? How are the bins affected by the treatments?

Gabriel - Write the results to Overleaf

Gabriel - Interpret coefficients. Come up with technical analysis for treatment effects. We know by the distributions that treatments 3 and 4 are the best apparently, but we don't have p-values or coefficients' analysis to corroborate with this conclusion. Write it to the Conclusion.
    - Levi: 
        - "since we have no placebo treatment, it is a bit tricky: depending on which treatment is your reference (trt 4 by default), the effectiveness of that treatment is given by the time coefficients, as those correspond to the amount of change caused by treatment 4 over time. to judge the other treatments, you have to look at trt*time interaction coefficients, as those will give you the additional change compared to trt 4, and to determine if those treatments are significant"
        - "well, higher would mean they are better, and the p-value will tell you if they are significantly different"
        - "regardless if the coefficient is positive or negative"

Fabio & Carlo - methodology

Gabriel & all - conclusion
All - references

Fabio & Carlo - Interpret covariance parameters & R correlation
Marco & Davide - explain why we use REML and SATTERTHWAITE
